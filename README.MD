# Image_Modifier
### Modify and Convert image between different formats 

This script can perform any of the three basic actions based on user input
1. Rotate image
2. Resize image
3. Convert image  

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

The script enables a user to preprocess a single image or bunch of images in a given directory

Simply run the script and provide the absolute path to the file or directory containing files to be preprocessed

For a single file conversion, the converted file is saved in the parent folder
For a bulk conversion of a directory, you will need to state an output folder where the images will be converted into 

## How to use 
- Download and run the script in any directory of your choice
- Input the absolute filepath of the file or image directory
- Select an option to either Resize, Rotate or Convert an image or bulk of images
- Enjoy !!!

## Python Techniques Employed
- PIL image module
- Python os and sys module

I will continue to modify this script as time goes on
This work of mine is open source, feel free to make changs and commits if you deem it fit </br>
Enjoy your useage
